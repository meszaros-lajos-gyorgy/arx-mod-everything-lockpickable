# arx-mod-everything-lockpickable

An Arx Fatalis mod that makes doors and other locked things which were previously impossible to open by the player
possible to open with lockpicking.

An example is the door to Miguel's smithy, or Tafiok's shop in the city of Arx when they are not in their shops.

The highest level of mechanical skills you will need is 99.

Fun fact: anything locked with the lockpicking difficulty of 100 is treated as unpickable by the Arx engine.
