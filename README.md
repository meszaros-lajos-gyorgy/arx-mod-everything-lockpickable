# Everything lockpickable mod for Arx Fatalis

This mod makes doors and other locked things which were previously impossible to open by the player
possible to open with lockpicking.

The highest level of mechanical skills you will need is 99.

## Features

The following doors are now pickable:

- Miguel's smithy (level 1, city of Arx)
- Tafiok's shop (level 1, city of Arx)

_TODO: add a complete list of doors and locks that have been changed_

Fun fact: anything locked with the lockpicking difficulty of 100 is treated as unpickable by the Arx engine.

**Compatible with
