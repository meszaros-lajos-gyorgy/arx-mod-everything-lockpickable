 Everything lockpickable mod for Arx Fatalis
---------------------------------------------

This mod makes doors and other locked things which were previously impossible to open by the player
possible to open with lockpicking.

The highest level of mechanical skills you will need is 99.

The following doors are now pickable:

- Miguel's smithy (city of Arx)
- Tafiok's shop (city of Arx)
- gate behind Gladivir's puzzle (crypt level 3)

TODO: add a complete list of doors and locks that have been changed

Fun fact: anything locked with the lockpicking difficulty of 100 is treated as unpickable by the Arx engine.
